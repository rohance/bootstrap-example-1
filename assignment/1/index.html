        <p>

            Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's
            electromagnet and a suit of powered armor. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop, Yinsen sacrifices himself
            to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the
            dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by
            Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home
            workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more
            powerful arc reactor.

            Stark learns that Obadiah Stane has been engaged in arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging
            a coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the
            villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest, revealing that Stane
            was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it and
            defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being "Iron Man."</p>
